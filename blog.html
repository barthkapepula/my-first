        "As he thinketh in his heart so is he."<br>
        The value of every man is compared to how much he or she thinks.<br>
        If you can't think POSSIBILITY, you can't see posisbility.<br>
        There are barriers on the way of everyone to acces his or her promise land. <br>
        it's only possibility mentality that empowers people to maintain a man's energy<br>
        in pursuit of a given task.<br>
